# World_Weather_Analysis
This is the project where we develope and refine a phone application called PlanMyTrip. 

# Overview
The CEO has some reccomendations to imporve the app. In particular, The CEO wants to add the weather description along with the latitude, longitude, city, country, and the Hotel Name for each destination. The tools to conduct the project are Jupyter Notebook and Google Maps. 


# Results
The first step to generate the layer maps is to generate a set of latitudes and longitudes, obtain the nearest city, and generate a API call with the software called OpenWeatherMap.  From here, we have created a DataFrame displaying the city, country, latitude (Lat), longitude (Lng), Maximum Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness, Wind Speed, and the current weather description. Here is the dataframe shown below, displaying the first 10 rows.

The next step is to retreieve customers preferences to the weather. We then use each customers weather preferences to pinpoint potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. All of the code is presented in a folder called "Vacation_Search". 
Then, just for extra measure, we showed these destinations as pop-up markers on a Google marker layer map. Here is the map shown below presented by using the DataFrame.

The final step is to use a Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary showing the route between four cities including a pop-up marker for each city. 

Here is an example of an itinerary generated by Google Maps API software shown below. There are three mode of traveling when using google maps. They are walking, driving, and bicycling. Here is an exmple of a itinerary map showing the route by walking starting and ending at Havelock, North Carolina.

Here is the itinerary map showing the same four cities but this map includes the markers for each stop in the itinerary.
